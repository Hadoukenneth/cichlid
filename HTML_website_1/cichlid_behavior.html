    <p>The aggressive personalities of these fishes give them character, but this
    trait may make them unsuitable to be kept with other fishes of nonsimilar
    temperament. The aggressiveness do generally vary from species to species
    and also from individual to individual, but fortunately there are several
    ways to reduce the in-fighting within your cichlid community. One way to
    reduce the fighting is to add many hiding places for fishes to retreat
    in case of nippy behavior. Another thing owners can do is to have several
    other fishes that are either the same temperament or are larger in size in
    comparison to the cichlid species. This will reduce the pressure and stress
    on each individual fish, as they will be targeted less. The larger the
    cichlid's tankmate is, the less likely the cichlid will nip at it, and also
    the less damage the tankmate will sustain.

  <p>The intelligence of cichlids make them fun pets. Using food as a treat,
    many cichlid owners are also able to teach their cichlid tricks such as
    jumping and rolling over. A study funded by the Austraillian Research
    Council discovered that archerfish can differentiate between human faces.
    Cichlids are also one of the rare fishes that tend to their fry. Their
    intelligence allows them to form a complex social hierarchies within your
    aquarium. Within each heirarchy, the dominant fishes will exert its
    dominance over fellow tankmates in the form of aggression. In large
    communities, the crown of being the dominant fish can change overnight! The
    colors on the dominant fish's scales would also change into a deeper color.
